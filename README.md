# Treasure Hunt

This first exercise will have you finding and copying files from locations in the treasure hunt folder to your solutions folder.

## Finding the first file

The first file we want is in the folder search_in_here which is in treasure_hunt, move to this directory.

Then by listing the files with a long list identify the third file. (not including hidden files or `.` and `..`)

Making use of `..` copy this file to the `treasure_hunt_solution` folder.

Move to `treasure_hunt_solution`.

If you have followed the instructions correctly then the next instruction will be in this file. Otherwise the file is empty.
